# Leetcode 207. Course Schedule


## 题目

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

Example 1:

Input: 2, [[1,0]]

Output: true

Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

Example 2:

Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]

Output: false

Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
Note:

The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.

You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.


## 思路ideas

从当前节点开始BFS。Level order traversal in graph. 比较每一个遍历的点mapping出来的值是不是target。如果是就return。如果不是，把这个点的邻居都加入queue里。注意加的时候用hash 先检测一下要加的点有没有被遍历过。

对于Queue 的题目，一般模版：
- initial a queue 存下一层需要visit 的node
- initial a ?? hash set 存已经visited 的node, 这样可以保证visit 过的元素不会被遍历第二次
- 把root 或者当前node 放到queue 中
- 开始while loop, loop 条件是queue 不为空。 如果有node 满足条件，就返回

代码如下：

```java



```



## 总结Conclusion

- Topological Sort
- BFS
- time O(logn), Space O(1);
